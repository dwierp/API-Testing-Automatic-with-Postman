# API Testing with Postman for Contact List Application
 
## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive API testing suite for a Contact List Application using Postman. The goal is to ensure the API endpoints function correctly, handle both positive and negative scenarios, and validate responses. The testing will cover authentication, CRUD operations for contacts, and edge cases like invalid inputs and unauthorized access.

## Scope of Work ⚡
### 1. API Endpoints to Test:
   a. Authentication: Login, Logout
   b. Contact Management: Add, Update, Get, Delete, and List Contacts
   c. Negative Test Cases: Invalid inputs, missing fields, unauthorized access, etc.
### 2. Tools:
   a. Postman: For API testing and automation.
   b. Environment Variables: To manage dynamic data like tokens, URLs, and contact IDs.
### 3. Deliverables:
   a. A Postman collection with all test cases.
   b. Documentation of test scenarios and results.
   c. Environment setup instructions.

## Test Scenarios
### 1. Authentication
a. Login:
   i. Request: POST /users/login
   ii. Test Cases:
       - Valid credentials (status code: 200, token returned).
       - Invalid credentials (status code: 401, error message).
b. Logout:
   i. Request: POST /users/logout
   ii. Test Cases:
       - Valid token (status code: 200, success message).
       - Invalid token (status code: 401, error message).



API Testing: A Software Tester’s Secret Weapon 🛠️

As a Software Tester, I’ve learned one thing: great user experiences are built on the invisible foundations of solid APIs. While end-to-end testing often gets the spotlight, API testing is where we uncover some of the most critical issues before they reach the user.

Here’s why API testing is essential for us testers:
🔍 Deeper Insights: APIs expose the application's core logic, letting us identify defects early—without relying on the UI.<>
⚡ Faster Feedback: Testing APIs is faster and more efficient, especially in agile or CI/CD workflows.<>
🛡️ Security Matters: APIs are gateways to sensitive data. Testing them ensures they’re secure and resilient against threats.
🌐 Better Integration: APIs connect systems. We ensure these integrations work seamlessly in real-world scenarios.

Some of my favorite tools include [Postman/Swagger/etc.], but more than tools, it’s the approach that counts:
 👍 Write clear test cases for every endpoint.
 👍 Validate inputs, outputs, and error handling.
 👍 Simulate edge cases and unexpected data.

API testing isn’t just a skill; it’s a mindset. It’s about ensuring that the invisible threads that connect our applications are strong, reliable, and secure.
